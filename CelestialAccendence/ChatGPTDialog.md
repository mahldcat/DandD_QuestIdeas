 # Initial Prompt
D&D, liches are created via a process that involves necromancy,  sacrifice and requires many different evil acts.
Use the forgotten realms setting, create a process to achieve something like lichdom but would be used by a character or NPC that is in the "good" alignment spectrum

# Process
Creating a process for achieving something akin to lichdom for a character or NPC aligned with good in the Forgotten Realms setting requires reimagining the traditional dark and evil path to undeath in a way that aligns with the values and goals of good-aligned beings. This process should involve self-sacrifice, preservation of life, and protection of the innocent, turning the pursuit of immortality or extended life into a noble quest rather than an act of selfishness or evil.

## The Path to Celestial Ascendance
1. The Quest for Sacred Knowledge:
The aspirant begins by seeking out ancient, divine knowledge preserved by celestial beings or hidden in sacred texts, focusing on understanding the balance of life and death. This quest emphasizes the importance of wisdom, compassion, and righteousness, leading the aspirant to ancient temples, libraries in celestial planes, or conversations with divine entities.

2. The Pact of Selfless Service:
The aspirant must make a binding pact with a celestial being or deity, committing their extended existence to the service of good, protection of the innocent, and the fight against evil. This pact ensures that the powers granted will not be used for selfish purposes but for the greater good, under the watchful eye of their divine patron.

3. The Ritual of Divine Transcendence:
Unlike the dark rituals associated with becoming a lich, this ritual involves a ceremony of light and life. It is conducted in a consecrated place and requires rare components that symbolize life, sacrifice, and rebirth, such as the heart of a phoenix, water from a sacred spring, and a gem infused with pure sunlight. The aspirant must also secure voluntary offerings of life energy from willing creatures, symbolizing the collective support of life against the encroachment of darkness.

4. The Transformation:
Upon completion of the ritual, the aspirant's body is transformed into a vessel of celestial energy, becoming a beacon of hope and goodness. This transformation might not result in an undead form but rather a state of existence that transcends traditional life, such as a being of pure light or energy, retaining their consciousness and purpose but no longer subject to aging or disease.

5. The Oath of Eternal Guardianship:
The newly ascended being takes an oath to protect the realms of the living from the forces of evil, using their extended lifespan and abilities to guide, defend, and inspire others. They become guardians of sacred places, mentors to heroes, and defenders against the darkness, dedicating their existence to the balance and preservation of life.

6. The Legacy of Knowledge:
To ensure that their extended life remains a blessing and not a curse, the ascended being is tasked with spreading the knowledge and wisdom they have acquired, teaching others the importance of balance, compassion, and the pursuit of righteousness. This legacy ensures that their extended life benefits not only themselves but all of creation.

This path emphasizes the core values of good-aligned characters in the Forgotten Realms, transforming the quest for extended life from a selfish pursuit into a noble sacrifice for the greater good, aligning with the themes of selflessness, protection, and service that define heroes in this setting.

## Celestial Beings who would aid in this endevor

### Titles
what would be a better title to call this process--lich and lichdom don't work well

1. Aurorascendancy
This title combines "aurora," suggesting light and new beginnings, with "ascendancy," implying a rise to a higher state. It reflects the transformation into a being of light dedicated to the greater good.
2. Celestial Guardianship
This title emphasizes the role of the transformed individual as a protector under the guidance of celestial forces, highlighting their duty to guard the realms of the living against evil.
3. Eternal Sentinel
"Eternal" captures the aspect of immortality, while "Sentinel" underscores the protective role of the individual, suggesting a watchful guardian who stands against the forces of darkness.
4. Divine Paragon
This title conveys the idea of an individual who has achieved a pinnacle of divine virtue and serves as a model of goodness and light, embodying the highest ideals of the deities that support them.
5. Sacred Warden
"Sacred" emphasizes the holy and consecrated nature of the transformation, while "Warden" suggests a guardian role, indicating someone who preserves and protects life and the balance of the cosmos.
6. Radiant Ascendant
Combining "radiant," which suggests shining light and purity, with "ascendant," indicating a rise to a higher state, this title reflects the transformation into a being of pure, celestial energy dedicated to the service of good.
7. Luminary Shepherd
"Luminary" implies a source of light or inspiration, and "Shepherd" suggests guidance and protection, making this title suitable for someone who guides souls and protects the living while being an inspiration of good.
Each of these titles encapsulates a different aspect of the transformation process and its outcomes, from protection and guardianship to divine inspiration and service to the greater good. The choice of title can be tailored to the specific narrative or character arc within the Forgotten Realms setting, emphasizing the unique qualities and mission of the individual undergoing this noble path to immortality.


### Vessels
what sort of vessel would act as this being's phylactery, and what would be a better name for this?

For a being that embodies the principles of good, protection, and celestial guidance, their "phylactery" equivalent should reflect the purity, selflessness, and protective nature of their transformation. Unlike a lich's phylactery, which is often a hidden, guarded object containing the lich's soul, this vessel would be something that symbolizes life, renewal, and the bonds between all living beings. It would also serve as a source of strength for the being and potentially as a beacon of hope or sanctuary for others.

Suggested Vessel: The Beacon of Unity
Description:
The Beacon of Unity is not merely a container for the being's essence but a symbol of their commitment to the service of good and the protection of life. It could take the form of a beautifully crafted lantern, a crystal filled with ever-shifting light, or a tree planted in a sacred grove, depending on the being's personal journey and the deities they serve. This vessel radiates light and warmth, offering protection and healing to those who are pure of heart and serving as a guide to lost souls.

Characteristics of the Beacon of Unity:
Sacred Bond: The Beacon of Unity is intrinsically linked to the being's life force, but instead of serving as a vulnerability, it strengthens their connection to the world and its inhabitants, reinforcing their duty to protect and guide.
Source of Light: It emits a soft, comforting light that can dispel darkness and fear, offering sanctuary to those in need of refuge from the forces of evil.
Healing Aura: The beacon has a gentle healing aura, capable of soothing wounds of the body and spirit, reflecting the being's role as a protector and healer.
Symbol of Hope: Its presence inspires hope and courage among the forces of good, bolstering their resolve in the face of darkness.
Guardian's Focus: The vessel serves as a focal point for the being's powers, allowing them to channel their abilities more effectively in their role as a guardian.
Creation and Purpose:
The creation of the Beacon of Unity would be a significant part of the transformation process, requiring materials and rituals that embody the aspirant's commitment to good. The vessel's nature would be deeply personal, tied to the individual's past deeds, and reflecting their future mission. Unlike a lich's phylactery, which is often hidden away, the Beacon of Unity could be placed in a location where it can do the most good, such as in a temple, at the heart of a community, or in a sacred natural site, making its protection a shared responsibility with those it serves.
