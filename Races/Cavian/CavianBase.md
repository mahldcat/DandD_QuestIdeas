## Ability Score Increase:
+2 Charisma, +1 Wisdom
## Age:
Cavians mature quickly, reaching adulthood at around age 3. They live relatively short lives, often only up to 15 years, but they pack a lot of life into those years.

##Alignment:
They tend toward neutral good. Their herding nature gives them a strong sense of community, but they’re open-minded enough to explore different values and paths.

## Size:
Cavians are short and stout. They range from 3 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 40 and 60 pounds. Your size is Small.

## Speed:
Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

## Languages:
You can speak, read, and write Common and one language of your choice.

## Racial Traits
Gregarious Nature
Cavians are highly sociable with those they trust. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made when interacting with allies or creatures you’ve spent more than 24 hours with in peaceful circumstances.

## Suspicious but Open
Cavians are initially distrustful of outsiders but can quickly form bonds. You have proficiency in the Insight skill and can use it to detect whether creatures are being deceptive.

## Herd Instinct
When working in a group, Cavians excel at teamwork. As a reaction, when an ally within 30 feet of you that you can see is hit by an attack, you can impose disadvantage on that attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses after a long rest.

## Quick to Befriend
Once a Cavian opens up to a new ally, they form lasting bonds. You can form a "Friend Bond" with one willing creature you’ve traveled with for at least 7 days. While within 30 feet of your bonded friend, you both gain +1 to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can only maintain one Friend Bond at a time, and if you create a new one, the previous one fades.

## Brave
You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

## Keen Senses
You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

## Nomadic Wanderer (Optional Feature for Adventurers)
Not all Cavians stay with their herds; some venture far from home. You have advantage on any Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate wilderness, forage, or track creatures.

## Cavian Names
You could draw inspiration from their native guinea pig species, such as Cavia or other similar-sounding terms like Cavios, Caviar, or Cavish to add flavor to your worldbuilding.
